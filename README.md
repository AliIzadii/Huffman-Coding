# Huffman-Coding
Text File Compression using Huffman Tree.
In this project we are going to use a special tree data structure called the Hoffman Tree to compress the text file.
This program have the following capabilities:
1. Receive a text file as input (receive the file address and process it) and convert it to a zip file.
2. Display the code table in the output.
3. Receive zip file as input and rebuild text file.
4. Build a Huffman tree for all symbols in the input file and count the number of occurrences of each symbol in the text.
5. Generate CodeWord for each symbol using the Hoffman Tree (CodeWord table).
6. Read the CodeWord table from the zip file and the encoded form of the symbols, and then rebuild the original file.
7. Show Huffman Tree.
